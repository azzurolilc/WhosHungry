###Our Motivation 
According to "National Geographic Magazine" to feed all the hungry in the world we would have to increase farming by 70% by 2050. However the same artical suggests that over half of the words food never makes to the table. Delta strives to create a system to help get food to the hungry and eliminate the waste of perfictly good food. 

###Project Intro
Delta Squad has set their sights on another humanitarian project. "Who's Hungry" will help companies and people alike by cut down on the unsuded food restaurants, grocery stores, and idividuals throw out. With a touch of a butten people can now share all their left over food. Use of this app will help cut down on the 133 billion pounds of food thrown out per year by grocery stores alone. Users will be able to select "share" or "eat" to pick if they are giving food away or coming to pick food up. "Who's Hungry" provides you with the addresses of the nearest "shares," shows you how to get there, and will help plan your route using your gps location.
