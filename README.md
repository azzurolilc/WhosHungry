##Our Motivation 
According to "National Geographic Magazine" to feed all the hungry in the world we would have to increase farming by 70% by 2050. However the same artical suggests that over half of the words food never makes to the table. Delta strives to create a system to help get food to the hungry and eliminate the waste of perfictly good food.
